Given an infinite number of sine and cosine curves we can fully represent an image.

    "As discussed above, low and high frequency information corresponds to different separations between telescopes. For a radio interferometric array the telescopes are often moveable, which means you can choose a configuration for the telescopes, depending on what is best for your science. For example you can choose to:\n",
    "* Place all of the telescopes close together. \n",
    "* Spread out the telescopes as much as possible. \n",
    "* Keep some telescopes close together, while spreading out some of the telescopes over large distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are advantages and disadvantes to each of these choices. On Glow you will find three fits images. They represent reconstructed images using:\n",
    "* Only low frequencies (M101_lowonly.fits)\n",
    "* Only high frequencies (M101_highonly.fits)\n",
    "* A mix of high and low frequencies (M101_low+high.fits)\n",

Calculate the SNR for these elements as you did in lab 5, by selecting out regions in the image that represent background, and regions that represent signal, and using these regions to calculate the SNR. \n",
