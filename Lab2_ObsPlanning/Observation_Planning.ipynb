    "Let us assume you have a list of scientifically interesting targets, and you are now interested in estimating how long to look at each object.

    "\n",
    "You will learn much more about this in the CCD Equation lecture, but here we will use a simplified version. For an object that is much brighter than the background, the $N_{star}$ term will dominate, resulting in $SNR\\propto\\sqrt{N_{star}t}$. If $N_{star}$ is constant then the SNR scales with the square root of the observing time. If the observing time is constant then the SNR scales with the square root of the flux, which is proportional to the flux of the object.\n",

This information can then be used to scale to your particular objects.\n",
