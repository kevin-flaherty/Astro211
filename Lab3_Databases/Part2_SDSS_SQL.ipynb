    "In the first part of this lab, you were (briefly) introduced to the world of online astronomical databases, and shown how to perform simple searches. The funcionality of these databases extends well beyond what you saw in the previous lab. One of the powerful features of these databases is the ability to select out data that fit a certain set of criteria (beyond simply a location on the sky). This can include e.g., selecting all of the bright, well-resolved, nearby galaxies, in order to make your own Hubble classification diagram. Or selecting out all of the stars within a cluster (based on RA, Dec, and distance) in order to create an HR diagram of the cluster, and hence measure its age.\n",
    "\n",
    "These complex queries are not possible with the simply query tools introduced earlier. To perform these tasks you need to learn about the Structured Query Language (SQL) a programming language for performing queries. To learn SQL, you will work through the SDSS SQL tutorial:\n",
    "([http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/help/howto/search/searchhowtohome.aspx](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/help/howto/search/searchhowtohome.aspx)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial can be completed entirely in the pages linked above, but SQL queries can also be completed within python. This notebook demonstrates how to call SQL queries within python. As you work through the online activity, record and execute your answers in the notebook below. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to place the commands into the SDSS pages, and then copy them here once you have them correct. This is because the SDSS pages return more helpful error messages than python. "
