    "A substantial part of learning python is practicing syntax. What you learned earlier may not have immediately stuck, and it takes time to memorize all of the appropriate syntax.

It is important to understand what the code is supposed to do, and to have some idea of what the result should look like, in order to catch these mistakes.\n",

Then click on it to find the code that produced it. You can also google for information, using searches like \"How to plot circles matplotlib python\". [Matplotlib cheatseets](https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets) are also available.\n",

    "Most plots will also include these lines:\n",
