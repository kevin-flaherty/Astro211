    "\n",
    "**Before you do anything else, go to File -> Save a Copy in Drive. Make any requested edits to that copy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Names: [Insert your names here]\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Part II of the bootcamp! Now that we've covered the basics, we can start diving into what makes programming useful and powerful. To begin, let's quickly review what we learned in Part I of this tutorial. *Note: You'll need to run all code cells of this tutorial in order.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Declarations\n",
    "We learned that to store information (of any kind) in Python, we want to set a variable name equal to that information, and then use that name to perform calculations on it \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "We learned that Python has different rules for different kinds of data — it performs calculations differently on integers than on floats, treats lists differently than numpy arrays, etc. Figuring out what data type is the most efficient and effective way to work with your data is one of the key conceptual skills to learn when programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists and Indexing\n",
    "We learned that the \"default\" way to store simple data (say, a bunch of numbers) is in a **list**, which can then be **indexed** by element number (starting with zero) to extract values from the list. We learned that lists can be fed into certain functions, like sum(), to return the sum of all numbers in the list (assuming the list is, indeed, all numbers). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging (barely)\n",
    "You probably didn't notice, but we practiced a little bit of debugging as well — we printed out lists to make sure they were filled with the numbers we wanted after a calculation, a simple form of debugging! \n",
    "\n",
    "## What we will cover in Part II \n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, I hope you will be able to handle the first task a professor might give you when starting to do research with them — loading up some data from a simple ASCII file, performing some calculations, and plotting it. To do all this, we will need to learn a bit of the Numpy Library, some **conditional statements** and **loops**, and some basic plotting techniques. Without further ado, let's jump in! "

    "### Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Beyond\n",
    "In Part I of this tutorial, we had to resort to calling a special data type that was not native to Python — the Numpy Array. This was useful to us because of a special behavior: Operating math on an array performs the operation on each value in the array, useful for say, subtracting the mean from every value and then squaring every value. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what *is* Numpy, actually? \n",
    "\n",
    "Believe it or not, from a mathematical perspective, what you saw in Part I was just about the limit of Python's native math functionality. You can add, subtract, multiply, exponentiate, and take modulos. To do anything more complicated — like, say, calculate a sine or cosine, we need to actually **import** libraries of functions which can accomplish these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's a function? \n",
    "It's useful to take a second to make sure we're on the same page about functions. A function is something that takes one or more inputs, and spits something out. When, in math class, you write y = sin(x), \"sin\" is the function you are using. The \"x\" you are plugging in is the *argument* of that function, and you are storing its *output* in the variable \"y\". If I use the range() function, to create a list from 1 to 10, "

    "It's day 1 of your new research assignment. You've just met with the professor or post-doc. They've probably given you like 10,000 papers to read (skim). They might also have given you a file or two of data, and told you to \"familiarize\" yourself with the format, get it into Python, and make some plots. \n",

In Ye Olde Days, basically all data were kept in plaintext ASCII files — in short, text. Things have changed recently, though often times data tables are still the most efficient means of storage, they are now wrapped inside file formats like FITS and HDF5 to make them more portable and stable over time. At the end of the day, we are most interested in getting past those layers of protocols to the raw numbers underneath, which we want sitting around in arrays we can mess with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with that most simple of cases: The ASCII text file. Download the \"quantum_mechanics.grades\" file from your email, and upload it to this workspace by clicking the folder icon on the left. This will display the local storage space. Then click the *Upload to storage session* button (that looks like a file with an up-arrow). From here you can upload the file. *Note:* Often, when working with ascii, programmers will set up their programs to output text files with extensions that indicate what they are (like data.spec and data.phot), rather than .txt — but rest assured, they are all text files and can be viewed in a text viewer like Sublime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the text file is in the same directory you are running this notebook in. Your first task: Look up the **documentation** for Numpy's loadtxt() function — you can do so online (google the function) or by typing help(np.loadtxt) in a cell here in this Notebook. Once you've done that, use the cell below to load the data into a variable called class_grades. We're going to continue with our dataset from Part I.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file you are loading contains 2 columns, the first is the name of the student, the second is their grade on the exam. If you just try to run np.loadtxt() on the file, you'll get an error, because it cannot turn the names into floats. Make sure to look at the \"dtype\" option in the documentation, and try setting it to string — this will turn all things into strings, but we can extract the numbers easily later."

But what if class_dictionary wasn't defined in my code? My function couldn't run. If I copied and pasted my function into another file, it wouldn't run by default. In short, it's not **general**. It's best to make your code as reasonably generalizable as possible — it will help you re-use your own code later, and catch bugs. I can make my function more generalizable by requiring the user to *provide* a class_dictionary to the function. That truly isolates it, and means I can move it from file to file or know that my tests of it aren't importing problems from elsewhere in my code. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. The string matching from argument to dictionary key is exact — the user can't enter 'malena' if the key was 'Malena'. The best way around this might be to coerce all the strings to be all lower or upper case in the dictionary, and then coerce the user input to the function to be the same case (upper or lower) before attempting to query the dictionary. Look up how to make strings upper or lower case, and implement that in your function. Don't necessarily go out and change how we created the dictionary in the first place, /within/ your function, update all the names in the dict to meet this need. \n",
    "2. What if someone enters a name in your function that, once problem 1 above is accomplished, isn't in the dictionary (not in class, or misspelled). As of now, your function will stop and throw a \"key error\", and say that the name is not in the dictionary. For the sake of exercise, let's change that behavior, and ignore it if a name isn't included moving on to all the other names and still producing the plot. Update your function such that if a name isn't in the dictionary, it prints a warning \"Warning, ___ wasn't in the class dict, continuing...\" so the user knows, but then still plots the rest of the (working) names. You could do this with an if-statement before actually querying the dict, or if you're adventurous, look up \"try and except statements\" online. \n",
    "3. Look around plt.barh's documentation, and see if you can make your plot do the highest scorer in a different color than the rest. Note, the easiest way might be to go through once plotting all in one color, and plotting the new color for the top score bar on top of it. \n",
