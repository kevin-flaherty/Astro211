Knowing whether or not to use a for loop is a separate problem than knowing the exact syntax of a for loop. Pseudo-code uses a mixture of code and plain english to represent a program in a way that avoids any concerns about syntax, but still makes clear how the program is designed to work.\n","\n","As an example, lets consider the function from the first lab that took in an array of numbers and returned the sum of these numbers. The exact python code was:\n","\n"," ```\n"," def sum_func(array_like):\n","    out_sum = 0\n","    for i in array_like:\n","        out_sum += i\n","    return out_sum\n","```\n","\n","Converting to pseudo-code this becomes:\n","\n","```\n","sum_func(an array of numbers)\n","  Set initial sum to 0\n","  For each element in input array of numbers:\n","    Add element to sum\n","  Return sum\n","```\n","\n","From this pseudo-code you can see that you will need a variable that contains the sum, and you need to know the syntax for looping over the elements in a list. The pseudo-code doesn't worry about exact variable names, or exact syntax, but does include the for loop and the return statement. \n","\n","Now lets consider an example of going in the other direction (converting from psuedo code to actual code). In the first lab you wrote a function that would go through a list of students and their grades and sort the students as either proficient or struggling. The pseudo-code version of this algorithm looks like:\n","\n","```\n","For student and grade in class list\n","  If grade is greater than average grade\n","    Add student to profcient student lest\n","  Else\n","    Add student to struggling student list\n","```\n","\n","This pseudo-code makes it clear that we need to loop over every student in the list, and compare the grade of that student to the average for the class. Based on this comparison the student is either added to the proficient student list or the struggling student list.\n","\n","From this psuedo-code you can imagine how to construct the actual piece of code. You will need lists for proficient students and struggling students, and you need to be able to add new entries to each of these lists. You will need to know the average grade for the class, as well as have a class list that contains names and grades (these may be defined earlier in the code). You will also need to figure out how to loop over the class list in a way that gives you access to both the grade and the student name. The exact python code for completing this task was:\n","\n","```\n","proficient_studnts = []\n","struggling_students = []\n","for i in class_grades:\n","  if float(i[1]) > mean_score:\n","    proficient_students.append(i)\n","  else:\n","    struggling_students.append(i)\n","```\n","\n","There are no formal rules for pseudo-code, or for how detailed to be when writing pseudo-code. Being too general isn't helpful (i.e., replacing the second example with `sort the students based on their grade` is not very helpful) but if you include too much detail then you end up just writing the function. Psuedo-code is best viewed as a tool to help you think about how a piece of code is structured, without worrying about the exact syntax. Include as much, or as little, detail as is helpful for you to understand how the code operates.

This includes correcting for the bias level, the dark current, and inhomogeneities in the sensitivity across the detector. These contributions can be accounted for with the use of bias frames, dark frames, and flat field images. *Bias frames* are images with an exposure time of zero, and represent the number of counts that each pixel starts with before any contribution from the sky, or other sources of electrons. *Dark frames* represent the contribution from the thermal electrons; they are matched to the exposure time of the science image since the thermal signal increases with time. *Flat field frames* are images of a uniformly illuminated object. Any differences in the recorded signal between different pixels in a flat field image are most likely due to differences in the response rate of different pixels.\n","\n","Bias and dark frames are subtracted from the science image, while a normalized flat field frame is divided off to produce a processed image.
